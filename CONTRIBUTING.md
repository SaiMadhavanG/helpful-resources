# Contributing Guidelines 

**Feel free to make a PR!** 
For an in-depth guide on how to make a pull request, you may visit the [Zense YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYmIQgrSF2E) 

These are the steps to follow:
- Navigate to the correct folder that you wish to add a link to your resource to. (Or, if no such folder exists, feel free to create one!) If you'd like to add an appropriate sub-folder, please do.
- Then, you can append your content to the `RESOURCES.md` file, as follows:
  - `<LINK> <DESCRIPTION>`
  - You may refer to [this](https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links) page for the syntax of hyperlinks in Markdown.   

A sample template is at `TEMPLATES.md`.
